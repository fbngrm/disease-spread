## Overview

This is your new Kedro project, which was generated using `kedro 0.19.6`.

Take a look at the [Kedro documentation](https://docs.kedro.org) to get started.

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `requirements.txt` for `pip` installation.

To install them, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Virtual Environment

It's good practice to setup a virtual environment to intsall the dependencies. Take a look at the [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) documentation to get started.

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

```
kedro run
